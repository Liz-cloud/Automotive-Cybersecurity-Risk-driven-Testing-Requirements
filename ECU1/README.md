#### Instructions to run  code:
- This will send sensor data from the Door Control Module, Headlight Control Module and Belt Control Module to the Body Control Module influencing output sensors's behaviour
- If you press the Door button it will simulate the Door Lock and Unlock status
- If you press the Light button it will simulate the Light levels (low and high) status
- If you press the Belt button it will simulate the Belt ON and OFF status
- The print and error output for running the BCMM.py are found in the Sensor_data_script.log file

##### Observe output sensors' behaviour and red log files of error diagnostics
